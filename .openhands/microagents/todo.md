# Missing Elements in Mac Client MVP Specification

This document outlines specific technical gaps in the current Mac client MVP specification that need to be addressed for a complete implementation guide.

## Technical Implementation Details

- [x] **Socket.IO Implementation Details**:
  - [x] Specific implementation details for handling Socket.IO connections
  - [x] Reconnection strategy when connection is lost
  - [x] Error handling for Socket.IO events
  - [x] Event queuing during disconnections

- [x] **UI Component Architecture**:
  - [x] Detailed breakdown of UI components and their relationships
  - [x] View hierarchy and navigation flow
  - [x] Specification for how the MVVM pattern should be implemented for each feature

- [x] **File Explorer Implementation**:
  - [x] Details on how file system data will be fetched and cached
  - [x] Specification for file content display (syntax highlighting, encoding handling)
  - [x] Pagination or lazy loading strategy for large directories

- [x] **Agent Output Display Implementation**:
  - [x] Specification for how to handle different types of agent outputs (text, code, images)
  - [x] Details on output formatting and styling
  - [x] Scrolling or history management specification

- [x] **Backend Connection Management**:
  - [x] Details on connection persistence across app launches
  - [x] Specification for connection status indicators
  - [x] Retry mechanism details

- [x] **State Synchronization**:
  - [x] Specification for how to handle state synchronization between the app and backend
  - [x] Details on conflict resolution when state diverges
  - [x] Specification for handling stale state

- [x] **Error States and Recovery**:
  - [x] Defined error states for the application
  - [x] User feedback mechanisms for errors
  - [x] Recovery procedures for common failure scenarios

- [x] **Performance Considerations**:
  - [x] Specifications for handling large outputs from the agent
  - [x] Details on UI responsiveness during heavy operations
  - [x] Memory management strategy for long-running sessions

- [x] **Specific Swift Implementation Details**:
  - [x] Guidance on Swift concurrency approach (async/await, Combine, etc.)
  - [x] Details on property wrapper usage for state management
  - [x] Specification for dependency injection approach

- [x] **Event Handling Architecture**:
  - [x] Detailed specification for how events from the backend will be processed and routed to appropriate components
  - [x] Details on event prioritization and queueing

- [ ] **Implementation Verification**:
  - [ ] impl_error_handling.md has code about events handling in general, is that correct?
