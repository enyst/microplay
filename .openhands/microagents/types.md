# OpenHands Mac App Types

This document catalogs the data types needed for implementing the OpenHands Mac client.

# OpenHands Event System Architecture

## Core Event Architecture

In OpenHands, all interactions are modeled as events with these key characteristics:

1. **Event Hierarchy**:
   - `Event` (base class) - Common properties like timestamp, source, message
     - `Action` (events representing commands/operations)
     - `Observation` (events representing results/responses)

2. **Event Source**:
   - Any event can come from any source (`AGENT`, `USER`, `ENVIRONMENT`)
   - The same action types are used across sources (no user-specific actions)
   - Source indicates the origin, not the action capability

3. **Communication Flow**:
   - Frontend → Backend: Sends limited set of actions via `oh_action` socket event
   - Backend → Frontend: Streams all events (actions and observations) via `oh_event`

## Frontend → Backend

When a user interacts with the UI, the frontend sends an action to the backend through the `oh_action` socket event. The primary action types sent from frontend include:

1. **CmdRunAction** - Execute terminal commands
2. **MessageAction** - Send user messages to agent
3. **ChangeAgentStateAction** - Modify agent execution state (pause/resume)
4. **FileReadAction/FileWriteAction** - File operations

The Mac app needs to implement methods to generate these action payloads based on UI interactions.

## Backend → Frontend

The backend streams all events to the frontend through the `oh_event` socket event. The Mac app must handle the full range of event types:

### Action Events
Actions that either the agent, user, or environment has initiated:

1. Command Actions:
   - **CmdRunAction** - Terminal command execution
   - **IPythonRunCellAction** - Python code execution

2. File Actions:
   - **FileReadAction** - File reading
   - **FileWriteAction** - File writing
   - **FileEditAction** - File editing (more complex operations)

3. Browser Actions:
   - **BrowseURLAction** - Web browsing
   - **BrowseInteractiveAction** - Interactive browser control

4. Agent Control Actions:
   - **AgentThinkAction** - Agent thinking process
   - **AgentFinishAction** - Task completion
   - **AgentRejectAction** - Task rejection
   - **AgentSummarizeAction** - Result summarization
   - **AgentDelegateAction** - Task delegation
   - **ChangeAgentStateAction** - Agent state modification
   - **AgentRecallAction** - Memory access

5. System Actions:
   - **NullAction** - Empty action placeholder

### Observation Events
Results/responses to actions or system events:

1. Command Observations:
   - **CmdOutputObservation** - Command execution results
   - **IPythonRunCellObservation** - Python execution results

2. File Observations:
   - **FileReadObservation** - File content
   - **FileWriteObservation** - File write results
   - **FileEditObservation** - File edit results

3. Browser Observations:
   - **BrowserOutputObservation** - Web browsing results

4. Agent Observations:
   - **AgentThinkObservation** - Agent thought results
   - **AgentStateChangedObservation** - Agent state changes
   - **AgentCondensationObservation** - Memory condensation
   - **RecallObservation** - Memory recall results
   - **AgentDelegateObservation** - Delegation results

5. Status Observations:
   - **ErrorObservation** - Error information
   - **SuccessObservation** - Success information
   - **UserRejectObservation** - User rejection results
   - **NullObservation** - Empty observation placeholder

## Implementation Strategy

For Swift implementation:

1. Create a protocol hierarchy mirroring Python class hierarchy
2. Use enums with associated values for type-safe handling
3. Implement custom Codable conformance for JSON mapping
4. Use generic handling for unexpected event types

This architecture enables the Mac app to send concise user actions while consuming and displaying the rich variety of events generated by the OpenHands system.


## DETAILS

### Events (Backend to Frontend)

#### Base Event Structure
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-31T17:00:00.000Z",
  "source": "AGENT",
  "message": "Event message"
}
```

#### Event Types

##### CmdOutputObservation
Represents the output of a command execution.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-31T17:00:00.000Z",
  "source": "AGENT",
  "message": "Executing command: ls -l /workspace",
  "observation": {
    "observation": "CmdOutputObservation"
  },
  "content": "total 4\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 openhands openhands 4096 Jan 31 16:00 workspace",
  "extras": {
    "command": "ls -l /workspace",
    "cwd": "/workspace",
    "exit_code": 0
  },
  "success": true
}
```

### User Actions (Frontend to Backend)

#### Base User Action Structure
```json
{
  "action": "action_type_string",
  "args": {
    // Action-specific arguments
  },
  "timeout": 60 // Optional
}
```

#### Action Types

##### CmdRunAction
Executes a shell command.

```json
{
  "action": "CmdRunAction",
  "args": {
    "command": "ls -l /workspace",
    "hidden": false
  }
}
```

##### ChangeAgentStateAction
Updates the state of the agent.

```json
{
  "action": "change_agent_state",
  "args": {
    "agent_state": "PAUSED"
  }
}
```

##### MessageAction
Sends a message to the agent.

```json
{
  "action": "message",
  "args": {
    "content": "Hello, agent!",
    "image_urls": [],
    "timestamp": "2025-01-31T21:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

##### ReadAction
Reads the content of a file.

```json
{
  "action": "read",
  "args": {
    "path": "/workspace/file.txt",
    "start": 0,
    "end": -1
  }
}
```

##### WriteAction
Writes content to a file.

```json
{
  "action": "write",
  "args": {
    "path": "/workspace/file.txt",
    "content": "New file content"
  }
}
```

## Enumerations

### AgentState
Represents the current state of the agent.

- `LOADING`: Agent is loading/initializing
- `INIT`: Agent is initialized
- `RUNNING`: Agent is currently running/executing tasks

- `PAUSED`: Agent execution is paused
- `STOPPED`: Agent execution is stopped
- `FINISHED`: Agent has finished the task successfully
- `REJECTED`: Agent rejected the task or request
- `ERROR`: Agent encountered an error during execution
- `RATE_LIMITED`: Agent is rate-limited by an external service
- `AWAITING_USER_CONFIRMATION`: Agent is waiting for user confirmation
- `USER_CONFIRMED`: User has confirmed agent's action
- `USER_REJECTED`: User has rejected agent's action

### EventSource
Indicates the source of an event.

- `AGENT`: Event originated from the agent
- `USER`: Event originated from the user
